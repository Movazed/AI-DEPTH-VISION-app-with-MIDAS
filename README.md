# AI DEPTH VISION app with MIDAS
API (Application Programming Interface) is a type of software that provides a connection between computers or between computer programs. Furthermore, API helps interface within the software. There are often misunderstandings of why an engineer wants to implement API. First of all, rather than focusing on the value of the API, it is better to think about the value of the effect it brings. APIs make sense when they provide a channel through which businesses can access the current value in new ways.

This process is the first step toward design automation. The user designs a model, then transfers this model information through an API file format to midas Civil (Gen, CIM, or any other software that can receive the API data). The users can receive the structural analysis data with API format files and edit the result tables depending on the project requirements. The users can also use their preferred text editing software such as Excel, Word, etc.

These convenience features will help reduce the time and effort civil and structural engineers take to design similar structures and utilize pre-designed models built with 3D modeling software (which offers API) with Midas structural analysis software. Significantly, post-processing, such as calling the result tables or taking analyzed result diagrams, will reduce repeating the work process and help make a better decision. 

Midas API opens the gate to transfer JSON data format for users to expand their availability. We’ll explain the user involvement part within the whole API design procedure from this part.

This chart explains users’ roles when using Open API. It looks complicated; however, traditionally, most of the processes have been conducted by structural engineers. We only added a Civil API process (converting data to JSON format). Midas Civil opens pre, and post-processing data and operators to connect users’ 3D modeling and report forms. This process is just the beginning of applying design automation systems. 

Midas Open API will soon be open to all of our users. Our team of engineers and developers is currently working hard to develop API modules for an effective work process. We would like to hear your opinion and thoughts so please feel free to write in the comment section below on anything you would like to know about the upcoming Midas Open API.
